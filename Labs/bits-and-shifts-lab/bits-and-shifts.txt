To complete the bits-and-shifts-lab, follow the instructions here and fill in
your responses below. You will submit your edited version of this file.

It is assumed that you have already read and worked through the introductory
steps in http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40/assignments/lab06/bits-and-shifts.html.
If you have not, please do so now.

In all of the following questions, all variables are assumed to be of signed or
unsigned C integral types; we are not asking about floats, doubles, pointers,
etc.

If you are shaky on hex, then spend some time just entering positive and
negative numbers into the interpreter to see what they become in hex. Then, try
it the other way: enter a hex literal like 0x102 and see how it evaluates. Note
that by default in C, expressions are 32-bit and signed. Prepare to enter
0xfffffffe, but first guess what the decimal equivalent will be. Did you guess
right?

Now go on to answer the following questions. You may use the c_interpret program
to help you figure out the following or to check your answers.

===============================================
        Practice with numbers
===============================================

Try to figure these out in your head or on paper before confirming
the result with the interpreter.

Fill in your answer in the space under each question:

* Assuming variable x is an unsigned integer, what will the
  expression: x | 1 compute?

 bitwise or with 1 flips the first digit to 1 if not already so and leaves the
 other digits unchanged. as a result all numbers out of this operation will be
 odd.


* Write an expression that will evaluate to "True" (i.e., a nonzero
  value) if and only if unsigned integer x is odd. You MUST NOT use
  the mod operator. Good answers will use only a single C operator,
  but other interesting ones are possible using two or more
  operators. Do your best. (Hint: think about what even and odd
  numbers look like in binary.)

x & 1


* Would your answer change, and if so how, if x were a signed integer
  instead of unsigned?

the results will not change as negative odd signed ints also have 1 on 
their lsb


===============================================
        Practice with Hex and Shifts
===============================================


Fill in your answer in the space under each question:

* Give a number in decimal that is equal to the
  hex value 0x202.

  514


* Give a C expression using operators OTHER THAN (+ - * or /) that
  will multiply the unsigned variable "a" by 16:

a << 4

* Will the above expression work for a signed variable?

no

* Give a C expression using operators OTHER THAN (+ - * or /) that
  will divide the unsigned variable variable "a" by 16:

a >> 4

* Will the above expression work for a signed variable?

no

* Give a C expression using operators OTHER THAN (+ - * / or % ) that will
  yield the remainder when the unsigned variable "a" is divided by 8: 

a & 7


===============================================
              Masks and masking
===============================================

Assume the following declarations:

  uint16_t width = ...some number between 0 and 31 ...
  uint16_t lsb   = ......some number between 0 and 31 ...
  uint32_t bits  = ...some value (bit fields)....

  Assume the same naming conventions as in the arith bitpack
  assignment. "lsb" identifies the least significant bit of a bit field,
  with 0 being the "rightmost". "width" gives the number of bits.

* Fill in the expression below so that mask has 1 bits in
  the bit positions lsb -> lsb + width - 1, and zeros everywhere
  else. For example: if lsb = 4 and width = 8, the hex value
  of the mask should be: 0x00000ff0 (8 bits starting at position 4).

  If it's easier, you may declare some variables to hold intermediate
  values first, or you can just do it all on one expression:





  uint32_t mask = (0xffffffff >> lsb) << (32 - lsb - width)

* Assume the mask above is correctly computed, and that lsb and width
  are still available. Write an expression (using mask, lsb, and width
  as appropriate) to extract an unsigned integer of width "width" from
  position "lsb" in variable data.

  For example: if data = 0x12345678, then for the sample values above,
  the result would be 0x67 (the 8 bits of data starting at lsb 4).

  Provide your expression below. Note that it should not work only for
  the sample values 8 and 4, but should work for any values of width,
  lsb, and bits. Again, you can use the mask value computed above if you
  like. 


  Your expression here: (data & mask) >> lsb



===============================================
            Named Flags  
===============================================

In the "A few other things to try" section of the lab spec, the following flag
definitions are shown:

uint32_t REGISTERED = 0x80000000
uint32_t EVALUATED = 0x40000000
uint32_t QUEUED = 0x20000000
uint32_t DROPPED = 0x10000000
uint32_t UNDERGRADUATE = 0x080000

These are also available in your pulled file "namedflags.cfrag". So, the
following command will read in those definitions and then let you evaluable
expressions using them:

     c_interpret namedflags.cfrag -       

(Note the '-' at the end; without that, the interpreter won't wait for
more input from you.)


Also assume the usual C conventions for True and False; the value 0 is
False, any other integer value is True. 

* Write a declaration for flags that sets the flags REGISTERED and
  UNDERGRADUATE, but no others:

    uint32_t flags =     0x80080000 
    or using the flags = REGISTERED | UNDERGRADUATE

In the following, assume that flags is a uint32_t, but that the flags
could have any value. For example, when doing the second question
below, do not assume that the first has already run to turn off the
UNDERGRADUATE flag. 


* Write an expression that evaluates to True if and only if 
  the UNDERGRADUATE flag is on in "flags":

flags & UNDERGRADUATE


* Write an assignment statement that turns off the REGISTERED flag in
  "flags", but leaves all other flags unchanged:


flags = ~(0xffffffff & 0x80080000 )

data & flags

* Write an expression that evaluates to True if and only if both the
  UNDERGRADUATE and DROPPED flags are on.




((data & UNDERGRADUATE) >> 19) & ((data & DROPPED) >> 19)
