cvPack:
This file is part of the implementation for compress 40.
This file helps our overall program by 
performing image processing operations on PPM (Portable Pixmap) images.
It includes various functions to manipulate and transform these images. 
The program focuses on image processing operations, particularly 
converting between RGB and CV color spaces, trimming images, 
and working with pixel blocks.

bitword:
contains functions used by compress40, which specifically handles
the conversion from packed CV arrays to coded words and finally the
compressed file format and back.

compress40:
This file is the source code of compress40, the implementation for 
40image, designated to compress or decompress a given valid ppm down to 
approximately a third of its original size.

**************************************************************************/

To our knowledge, after testing our program repeatedly, our program runs 
as the spec expects it to. Our decompress and compress work according
to the spec. And our bitpack.c methods which are used to bitpack pixels
work according to the spec and the .h file we pulled as well. 
Overall, our program should act according to the spec.
