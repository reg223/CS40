Files:
-restoration.c: performs the restoration from corrupted p2 to p5.
-readaline.c: read a single line from the input file. 
-parseline.c/parseline.h: parse a single line into a digit sequence and a 
non_digit sequence. 

References:
We consulted numerious TAs for debugging and architecture design related 
quesitons. 
We also used ChatGPT and stackoverflow to understand the meanings of 
specific error messages, mostly valgrind errors, from the compiler. 

Correctness/Completion:
Readaline and Restoration are both correctly completed and can take 
greater than 1000 lines. We were able to restore all of the corrupted
images given to us with no Valgrind errors. 

Time Estimate: 
30 hours.
